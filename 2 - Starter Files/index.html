				<p>The two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut, 
					which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard,
				 	or other sweet fillings. Alternatively, small pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. 
				 	Once fried, doughnuts may be glazed with a sugar icing, 
				 	spread with icing or chocolate on top, or topped with 
				 	powdered sugar, cinnamon, sprinkles or fruit.<a href="">Click here to read more about our story</a></p>
